//! `RoomClient` — a loro-protocol room client over WebSocket, speaking to the
//! TS edge's SessionRoom Durable Object (`edge/src/session-room.ts`).
//!
//! Wire format (loro-protocol 0.3, identical bytes to the npm package the edge
//! imports): every frame is `4-byte CRDT magic ("%LOR"/"%EPH"/…), varbytes
//! roomId, 1-byte message type, payload`. The messages this client exchanges:
//!
//! - `JoinRequest {auth, version}` → `JoinResponseOk {permission, version}` /
//!   `JoinError {code, message}` — version bytes are Loro `VersionVector`
//!   encodings; the server backfills `export({mode:"update", from: clientVV})`
//!   or a full snapshot when the client VV is empty/garbled.
//! - `DocUpdate {updates[], batchId}` acknowledged by `Ack {refId, status}`.
//! - `DocUpdateFragmentHeader {batchId, fragmentCount, totalSizeBytes}` +
//!   `DocUpdateFragment {batchId, index, fragment}` for payloads above the
//!   256KB message cap (the edge fragments at 200_000 payload bytes).
//! - `RoomError {RejoinSuggested | Evicted}`, `Leave`.
//!
//! Sync discipline (mirrors the edge's expectations):
//! - On (re)join, the server's `JoinResponseOk.version` is used to export and
//!   push everything the server lacks — this doubles as resend-after-reconnect
//!   (unacked local commits are re-derived from the doc, never queued).
//! - `Ack{InvalidUpdate}` is the §3.1 stale-peer signal (import concurrent to
//!   a shallow-snapshot trim): the client rejoins on the same socket to resync
//!   fresh, then re-submits from the server's VV.
//! - `Ack{FragmentTimeout}` (reassembly state lost to DO hibernation): the
//!   whole batch is resent.
//! - Presence rides the `%EPH` sub-room as `loro::awareness::EphemeralStore`
//!   payloads relayed verbatim.
